<h1>About Me</h1>
<article>
    <br>
<span style="margin-left:20px;font-size:20pt;line-height: 2;">I was born on March 24th,1999 in Orlando, Florida.  I lived in the state of Florida for 14 years and later moved to Chicago, Illinois, where I would stay for 5 years.  My childhood was replete with wonderful memories coupled with important life lessons.  Throughout my life I have always maintained my integrity, even when it wasn't easy, my studious mind, even in hopeless times,  and my punctuality, even when no one else showed up.  My mission in life is to challenge my logical and creative thinking skills in order to present more opportunities for others in the world.  With my current and developing experience in technology, problem solving, and communication, I am focused on that mission.
